Unlike dogs, cats do not have a sweet tooth. Scientists believe this is due to a mutation in a key taste receptor.[4]
When a cat chases its prey, it keeps its head level. Dogs and humans bob their heads up and down.[9]
The technical term for a cat’s hairball is a “bezoar.”[6]
A group of cats is called a “clowder.”[7]
A cat can’t climb head first down a tree because every claw on a cat’s paw points the same way. To get down from a tree, a cat must back down.[9]
Cats make about 100 different sounds. Dogs make only about 10.
